This is an academic project on A Vehicle to Vehicle Communication Model for Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Cars

This paper proposes a Vehicle to Vehicle communication-based model for collision avoidance
by analysing the various parameters shared during communication and using the results of this
analysis to provide warning signals to the autonomous cars to avoid collision. 

The proposed collision avoidance algorithms greatly benefits from the information exchange between the ve-
hicles that are inside the Vehicular Ad-hoc network to calculate safe accelerations, distances,
and velocities that the vehicles would later take on to guarantee the avoidance of collision.
Simulations were done for three scenarios namely; Blind Spot, Intersection Movement Assist
and Forward Collision all of which were implemented using MATLAB. 

The results show that the proposed collision avoidance system makes a composite analysis of the collision risk and
then takes the necessary action to avoid the collision.
